# 🔮 Mystic Oracle — Streamlit + Groq (Tarot Chat)

A mystical chat app that blends **LLM prophecies** with **Tarot card draws**.  
Users ask a question, the Oracle replies in a short, poetic style, and cards are drawn (single or 3-card spread, including reversals).  
Built with **Streamlit** and **Groq** (Llama 3) and styled with a starry dark theme.
